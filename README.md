Just to inform you with Today this project is goping to be Expanded beacuse i did a little Planing on what i want to have and be able to do! (03.03.2024)
It started as a Simple Time Work Caclultion Webapp but now i am going to expand it to do way more things then just input when you started to Work and when you can leave.

I am going to adapt this Readme and wiki going on and on.

Please keep in mind the Website is not yet always up to date until i know how i could automate this to build its own Docker image rn i need to do it by hand.
Also this Project and looks of it may and probably will change alot until i am statisfied for a personal full release

As you can see in the main.go file there is no handler for https and no cert set this is because in my setup i am running this site behind a reverse proxy which handles the Certs and HTTPS connections.
I should als add the information or a Disclaimer yes internally if u use it like a internal tool there is no Security and encryption as it only works with http cause we are not saving or serving personal data,
this should be fine for me atleast. 

Side Note:
This Project is only going to be coded and mantained in my Free Time but this is not going to be my Main Point to do after Work so some things like replys changes fixes etc could take their Time and should since i do it for Fun.
Also if somone would like to be with me and give me LIVE input the development and planning of this whole Project is going to be Streamed lived on Twitch and Youtube.
